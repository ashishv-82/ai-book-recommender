# 📚 Intelligent Book Recommendation System

Discover how to build an intelligent book recommendation system using the power of large language models and Python. Learn to transform book descriptions into mathematical representations that enable precise content-based matching. By the end of this project, you'll have built a recommendation engine that helps readers discover their next favorite book.

## 🚀 Project Highlights
- **Semantic Understanding:** Moves beyond simple keyword matching to understand the *context* and *theme* of book descriptions.
- **LLM Integration:** Utilizes Hugging Face Transformers to generate high-quality text embeddings.
- **Interactive UI:** A functional web interface built with Gradio for real-time recommendations.
- **Vector Search:** Leverage embeddings for fast and accurate book discovery.
- **Classification & Sentiment Analysis:** Use zero-shot classification and sentiment analysis to enhance recommendations.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Python 3.12+**: Core programming language.
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)**: For Large Language Model (LLM) processing.
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning backend for mathematical representations.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and book catalog management.
- **LangChain**: Framework for working with LLMs and vector stores.
- **Gradio**: Web-based user interface for interactive recommendations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization for book clusters.
